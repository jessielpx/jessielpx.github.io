I graduated from Western University (Canada) with a Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences in 2022. After 9 months of full-time work at Yinfeng Gene Technology company (China), I started the Human Genetics Master's program at McGill University (Canada) in the Summer of 2023. I am particularly interested in the genomic patterns associated with tumor progression. I am doing my Master's thesis on optimizing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay for DNA from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples in cancer research, using renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a model. I am also studying the association between co-occurrent mutations, copy number variation (CNV), and clinical outcomes in clear cell RCC cohort.
