## Understanding the Molecular Characteristics of Sarcomatoid/Rhabdoid Renal Cell Carcinomas through Integrative Histological and Spatial Genomics Approaches
---
Time: May 2023 - Present  
Institute: McGill University  
Supervisor: Dr.Yasser Riazalhosseini  
*	Genomic Analysis: Investigated mutation patterns in Sarcomatoid/Rhabdoid renal cell carcinoma patients across tumor histology, S/R features, and metastatic sites.
*	Generated Oncoplots to visualize the mutational landscape of S/R RCC-related genes. Determined if genes are unfunctional due to mutations or the loss of chromosomes by looking at the copy number variation. Investigated the patterns in tumor mutation burden by generating correlation plots.
*	Analyzing international Cancer Genomics of the Kidney Consortium (CAGEKID) data for comparison and reference. Studied the co-occurrence of S/R RCC-related genes. Examined the independence between mutations in VHL and other S/R RCC-related genes.
